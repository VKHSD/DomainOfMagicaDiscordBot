Magica Assistant is a discord bot that can simulate DPS, drop chances, coin-flips, and full hell-raids/cruins drops.

You must replace 'TOKEN' with your discord bot token. Your bot must be able to type, read, and view the history of chats and have administrator permissions.

all software written by VKHSD, use is allowed but redistribution would make me sad, but there is nothing I can do to stop you.

If there are any errors let me know.

buy me a coff~... I'm just kidding. I'm not that poor to ask for $2 XDDD.

dm me on Discord if you have any suggestions, my username is 'lsd2'

You can install the libraries using the command, pip install -r requirements.txt
